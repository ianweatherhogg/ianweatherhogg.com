# Problem

I find programming (computers) a fascinating vocation from the perspective
learning vista is infinite and that the way to use this knowledge for creative
means is also limitless. As I continue to be in awe of new things I learn I
dwell on things I wish I'd know which would have facilitated my journey to
date. This is personal message to myself; Ian to Ian

In a nutshell; learn emacs/vi, comfortable in bash, know regex, find,
grep, learn by reading other peoples code, experiment, produce your
own code.

know search tools (find, grep), comfortable with regular expressions,
comfortable in bash (and bash scripting), know linux and don't be afraid
with the internals

# Mummurings

I see programming as conversations with the compiler and the host platfrom
(upon which it sits)


Points - context is general

Close to the metal
bash, emacs, vi
looking at code, search tools
elisp
functional programming
type orientated programming 
exposure to lots of languages
effective tinkering - spin up a repl and get something to function
repl orientated programming

linux - archlinux - install process, bash scripts, processes running
memory configuration etc

read other peoples (good) code
generate your own code (bad at but addressing)

using the above for application
machine learning statistics probability
architecture scalability
security
optimization (root of all evil)
profiling tools, algorithmic and O notation

parsers
old tools; find, grep, awk, sed

inside out
inside; emacs, compilers, search, learning through code
out: context; games, machine learning, trading

thought that learning by books, although great, looking at code,
experiment with it and use stuff learnt to write your own

reference to Joe Armstrong - emacs, examples, actually just typing
stuff out
